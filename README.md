Time Tracking application for tracking your time spent on project

Funcionality: Create a project by entering name and start tracking. You can resume/delete or create new project.

Tools used for it:
React,
ReuxToolkit(for state managment),
localStorage(for storing data),
ReactRouter,
Vite;

Possible upgrades for future:

- Connect to database;
- Create user authentication;
- Add filtering functionality as there would be more projects to track;

To start this project on your local machine, just fork this repo, run npm i and npm run dev and that it ;)
